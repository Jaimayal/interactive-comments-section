## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- JSX markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - All-in-one framework
- [React](https://react.dev/) - Frontend framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) - State management library

### What I learned

I've learned a lot more about Astro, its not really great when it comes to web apps. I learned on how to integrate other frameworks and libraries with Astro (Like Tailwind, React and Nano stores).

### Useful resources

- [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) - The official documentation of Astro is very complete and easy to understand. The best resource if you're looking to learn Astro by far.
- [React docs](https://react.dev/learn)
- [Tailwind docs](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs)
